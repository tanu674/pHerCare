🩸 pHerCare — Smart Biodegradable Menstrual Health App

Detect. Track. Understand. Act.
A biodegradable smart pad + digital health app that detects vaginal infections early through pH monitoring — built for every woman.



🌸 What is pHerCare?




pHerCare is an innovative women's health solution that combines a biodegradable smart menstrual pad embedded with a pH indicator strip and a QR-accessible mobile web app.
When a woman scans the QR code on her pad, she's taken directly to a personalized health logging screen — no app download needed. She matches her strip colour, logs symptoms, and receives instant AI-driven health insights.

pHerCare bridges sustainable hygiene, preventive health monitoring, and digital intelligence — empowering women to detect hidden health risks early.
